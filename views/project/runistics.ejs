                <p class="article">I like running but I'm not too motivated to do it everyday. I thought it would be a great idea to bet with people for a fixed duration of time.
                Whoever runs the most wins. Very simple concept and could have easily been done by straight up just keeping track of runs in a month and paying in person but this way, I could practice
            some full stack web development. There were also a lot of challenges involved, and this is still an in-progress app. Here's the process: </p>
                <div class="divider"></div>
                <p class="section-title">Research</p>
                <p class="article">So, the application was supposed to do the following things:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Connect friends and set up a bet.</li>
                        <li>Keep track of the runs in that duration.</li>
                        <li>Notify users of the status.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="article">
                    Pretty straightforward. But, there were a lot of problems. Since I live in Champaign, IL it gets brutally cold in winters and running outside is not an option. So there are a fair amount
                    of runs that happen indoor on the treadmill. The two options I was looking at were Nike+ and Strava. Strava has no support for indoor runs so Nike+ was the obvious choice to track. Further problems came in when
                    I realised that Nike+ doesn't have a public api. In fact there are no existing developer documents about this thing. That was a huge challenge. I also kept in mind that I was doing this as a fun project for me
                    and a couple other friends so my priority was getting the job done. Even if I could create a manual input form application, that should solve the problem.
                </p>
                <div class="divider"></div>
                <p class="section-title">Design</p>
                <p class="article">
                    I spent a few hours on designing how the app would look like. Initially I wanted it to be an app because Nike+ is an app and its just easier to enter data on a phone than on the computer.
                </p>
                <img src="../img/project/runistics/design1.png" class="img-responsive">
                <p class="article">So basically, users create an account with the app. I am no longer using Strava or Nike+. After they are logged in, they are prompted to add a few friends. Setting up a bet is again very straightforward.
                They just add the people they want on the bet, duration and the money. After they are added, the users get a notification and an option to either accept or reject the bet. Once a bet has started, the stats are shown in the far right screen.
                All the required information is visible at a glance. The data is added manually where a user will be notified everyday at a certain time to enter run data manually which could be tracked by either Nike+ or directly from the treadmill. Full disclosure -
                the finished (sort of) product looks nothing like the design. Not that it has bad UI, but I went in a different direction as the app progressed.</p>
                <div class="divider"></div>
                <p class="section-title">Implementation</p>
                <p class="article">At this point I have realised that adding data manually isn't really feasible. Also another big pivotal point was that we decided not to compete with each other anymore. Last time I was doing it, I increased by average mileage by more than 300% within 5 days
                    and suffered a terrible case of Runner's Knee. Now, I decided that the competition would be with a target. For example, 500 kms a year is a decent target. I now wanted to pivot the app based on the target. Strava has a great public API so I decided to use that. I used NodeJs with a
                    mongoDB database, Express and the frontend was written in EJS. The finished product looks something like this.
